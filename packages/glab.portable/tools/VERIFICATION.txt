The glab repository on GitHub as of March 24 2022 has releases, while the GitLab repository does not.
The official source is GitLab going forward (https://github.com/profclems/glab/issues/983, https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/cli/-/issues/983), but until then I've captured the files from GitHub:
The embedded software has been downloaded from the GitHub release page <https://github.com/profclems/glab/releases/tag/v1.22.0>
and can be verified by doing the following:

1. Download the Windows zips (glab_1.22.0_Windows_i386.zip, glab_1.22.0_Windows_x86_84.zip) and checksums.txt
2. Get the checksum using one of the following methods:
  - Using powershell function 'Get-FileHash'
  - Use chocolatey utility 'checksum.exe'
3. The checksums should match the following:

  glab_1.22.0_Windows_i386.zip
  checksum type: sha256
  checksum: 43e86b78e919ec0a1947157c1eeaf62fa8bc03087f09affb28293af939ac4389
  glab_1.22.0_Windows_x86_84.zip
  checksum type: sha256
  checksum: 1b07931cbd9547fdf33bc5c636a5e70bc01d7ef68768cff13f9655623ce411d8
